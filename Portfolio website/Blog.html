    <h1>End <span class="" >of the first semester</span> </h1>
    <p>End of the first semester, as a computer science student at the BSc level I faced numerous challenges and it feels like I have learned so much in such a short amount of time. 
    I remember my first day of lecture 2022 /11/16 in college about the fundamentals of Computing which was given by module leader Mr.Uttam Acharya. I learned the basics of the computer system, binary numbers, decimal numbers, and bits. I attained the classes with proper attendance during the semester. I learned many things in my first semester. In Fundamental
    of Computing, I learned about Number and data representation, Boolean logic and logic gates, Arithmetic Logic Units, Sequential logic and Memory, CPU Architecture and Peripheral devices, Windows and Linux OS, Batch files for Windows OS, Database and SQL, and Networking. In the Academic Skills and Team-Based learning module, I learned about report writing, teamwork presentation skills, and many more things. In Introductory Programming And Problem-Solving, I learned java and python programming language. And in Web Technologies I learned basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages with these three programming languages I made a personal portfolio website. I took every assignment with confidence and was eager to show what I have learned. The coding challenges were tough, but I managed to complete them with the help of youtube and different online website like StackOverflow and learn along the way. This first semester helped me a lot to grow in terms of academics and personal connections. I developed many new skills like coding with different programming languages java, python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I meet different people with different goals toward their careers and I found a similar goal with Pravash sir who has reached his goal in life and guided me a little bit on how you can reach them. I learned many things from my own mistake this semester which is good because we human beings learn to form our own mistakes and other mistakes. My plan for the upcoming semester is to grow more in every aspect of life and academics. Mainly I am focusing on academic and personal goals. I am inspired by the people I met and the stories I heard, and it made me realize that there are so many possibilities in the world of computer science.
    I am pleased with my work as I look back on all the weeks of the first semester. I have learned a ton and have come a long way in understanding computer science. I am also grateful for the experience and the people I have met along the way. I'm excited to continue my journey in computer science. I know that there will be even more challenges and obstacles, but I'm confident that I have the skills and the drive to overcome them. I'm eager to see where this path takes me and look forward to what the future holds.
    In conclusion, this first semester has been an unforgettable experience. Studying computer science at Herald College Kathmandu has been both challenging and rewarding, and I have come a long way in a short amount of time. I am excited to see what the future holds, and I am determined to make the most of this opportunity..</p>
